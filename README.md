###⚙ How It Works
The Navbar provides navigation links (Home, Blogs, About) with active link highlighting.
The Home Page includes a description and a “Start a Blog” button that routes to the Blog List.
The Blog List Page dynamically lists all available blog posts (or placeholders).
The About Page shares project details and technology info.
All pages are rendered through React Router, ensuring smooth client-side navigation.

###🧩 Challenges and Solutions
Challenge----Solution
1. GitHub permission issues while pushing the project----Reconfigured Git username and email, cleared old credentials, and reauthenticated with the correct GitHub account.
2. Navbar not showing active link highlight----Used useLocation() hook from React Router to conditionally style the active page link.
3. Home page layout appearing left-aligned----Applied flexbox centering and limited content width using Tailwind (flex, justify-center, max-w-5xl).
4. Large image size and misalignment on the Home page----Added max-width and object-fit: cover properties to resize and center the image proportionally.
5. White blank page on navigation----Fixed incorrect import/export errors and ensured BrowserRouter correctly wrapped all components.
